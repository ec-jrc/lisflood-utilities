# Overview

This utility allows to create sectoral water demand maps at the desired spatial resolution and for the desired geographical areas. The maps indicate, for each pixel, the time-varying water demand map to supply for domestic, livestock, industrial, and energetic (cooling) water consumption. The temporal discretization of the information is monthly for domestic and energy demand, yearly for industrial and livestock demand. The users can select the historical temporal span of the output datasets (start year and end year). The maps of sectoral water demand are required by the LISFLOOD OS [water use module](https://ec-jrc.github.io/lisflood-model/2_18_stdLISFLOOD_water-use). Clearly, the scripts and the outputs of this utility can be used also for other applications, as well as for stand-alone analysis of historical water demand for anthropogenic use. Due to the large uncertainty of the global data sets, the distinction between demand and withdrawal is here omitted.

This README file provides detailed technical information about the input datasets and the usage of this utility. The methodology is explained in the manuscript: Choulga, M., Moschini, F., Mazzetti, C., Grimaldi, S., Disperati, J., Beck, H., Salamon, P., and Prudhomme, C.: Technical note: Surface fields for global environmental modelling, EGUsphere, 2023 ([preprint](https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2023-1306)).

The global sectoral water demand maps at 3 arcmin (or 0.05 degrees) resolution, 1975-2023, produced using the scripts of this utility can be downloaded from [Joint Research Centre Data Catalogue - LISFLOOD static and parameter maps for GloFAS - European Commission (europa.eu)](https://data.jrc.ec.europa.eu/dataset/68050d73-9c06-499c-a441-dc5053cb0c86)

# Data

The utility consists of five scripts which require several following datasets and files. The full list of datasets is provided below. For each dataset, this documentation provides the link and the instructions relative to available version at the time of creation of the scripts. The correct functioning of the scripts is guaranteed for those datasets. Clearly, updated versions are regularly published: one relevant example is [Global Human Settlement - Datasets - European Commission (europa.eu)](https://ghsl.jrc.ec.europa.eu/datasets.php) (see Global Human Settlement Layer (GHSL)). Albeit the functioning of the utility is expected to be maintained, the users are invited to report problems or suggestions via GitHub issues.

The locations of the datasets and files are specified in the configuration file (see the `config.cfg` example). The script also requires a template map which defines the output resolution and area. The template map should be in netCDF-4 format and contain `lat` and `lon` variables and a data variable (any name). The location of the template map is specified using `templatemap_path` in the configuration file. The data are produced for the period spanning `year_start` to `year_end` and saved in netCDF-4 format to `output_folder` (all specified in the configuration file). 
The option `shift_hours_units_start = 24` indicates the number of hours to shift the time reference unit for consistency with [end-of-the-timestep convention](https://ec-jrc.github.io/lisflood-code/2_ESSENTIAL_time-management) within OS Lisflood. It will affect the reference units field (e.g. "days since 1979-01-01 12:00:00") in the NetCDF output file.

# Methods

The module consists of five scripts:
1. `step1_population_density.py`: 
	1. Resamples the native resolution of the GHSL population grids to the template map resolution.
	1. Computes population grids (in density per km<sup>2</sup>) for each year using linear interpolation and nearest-neighbor extrapolation.
1. `step2_domestic_demand.py`:
	1. Produces a map of the R parameter (measures the relative withdrawal difference between the warmest and coldest months).
	1. Computes annual time series of population for each country.
	1. Loads the country-scale AQUASTAT municipal water withdrawal estimate and produces annual time series using linear interpolation and population-based forward and backward extrapolation.
	1. Loads the state-level USGS withdrawal data and computes annual values using linear interpolation and nearest-neighbour extrapolation.
	1. For each year, computes country- and state-scale per capita water demand and produces a global map.
	1. Annual per capita water demand for countries without any AQUASTAT information is estimated using nearest-neighbour interpolation.
	1. Spatially disaggregates the country- and state-scale annual per capita water demand estimates using the population estimates to obtain global annual withdrawal grids.
	1. Temporally downscales the annual withdrawal grids using monthly MSWX air temperature grids and the map of the R parameter.
1. `step3a_industrial_demand.py`: 
	1. Computes country-scale values of the Vassolo and Döll (2005) industrial and thermoelectric withdrawal grids.
	1. Processes the country-scale AQUASTAT industrial withdrawal data.
	1. Processes the country-scale World Bank manufacturing value added (MVA) data.
	1. Processes the GCAM regional industry and thermoelectric withdrawals and spatially downscales them to the country scale based on population.
	1. Processes the GCAM regional electricity consumptions and assigns values to each country.
	1. Computes annual country-scale manufacturing and thermoelectric withdrawal time series as follows:
		1. If AQUASTAT and GCAM data are available, temporally gap-fills the AQUASTAT industrial withdrawals using linear interpolation and MVA- or population-based extrapolation, temporally gap-fills the GCAM manufacturing and thermoelectric withdrawals using linear interpolation and nearest-neighbor extrapolation, rescales the GCAM manufacturing and thermoelectric withdrawals to match the Vassolo and Döll (2005) estimates, and temporally disaggregates the AQUASTAT industrial withdrawals into manufacturing and thermoelectric using GCAM.
		1. If only GCAM data are available, simply use the rescaled GCAM manufacturing and thermoelectric withdrawals.
		1. If neither AQUASTAT nor GCAM data are available, set the manufacturing and thermoelectric withdrawals to zero.
	1. Computes monthly heating degree days (HDD) and cooling degree days (CDD) grids using daily MSWX air temperature.

	1. Gap-fills the annual USGS manufacturing and thermoelectric withdrawal time series using linear interpolation and nearest-neighbor extrapolation.
	1. For each year, spatially downscales the country- and state-scale livestock withdrawals using the GLW total livestock mass grid.

# System requirements

The script can be run on a normal desktop PC, support is provided only for Linux. Physical memory requirements depend on the desired geographical extent and resolution of the maps dataset. For instance, the generation of  the sectoral water demand dataset for the global domain at 3arcmin (or 0.05 degrees) resolution required 32 GB.
